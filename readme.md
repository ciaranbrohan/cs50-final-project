<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Pathfinderr

This is my final project for cs50x, I built a pathfinding visualiser using vue.js, It focuses on using dijkstra's algorithm and a star for pathfinding, finding the shortest route between two points. 

I also added the ability to toggle walls to make your own maze or autogenerating walls (possible to not have a path return with the autogeneration)

This project was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/clementmihailescu">Cl√©ment Mihailescu's</a> Pathfinder tool. 

My main reason for building this was inspired by the sorting algorithm visualistions in week 3 of the CS50x course, and wanting to gain a better understanding of how pathfinding works.


### Built With

* [vuejs](vuejs)

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] allow drag to set multiple walls
- [ ] allow user to see history of algorithm
- [ ] maze algorithm
- [ ] allow playback of historical algorithm
- [ ] Bug Fix: improve path not found, intermittent bug here when large amount of walls exist
- [ ] Bug Fix: improve rendering of grid, error seems to appear when over 800 nodes 

See the [open issues](https://github.com/ciaranbrohan/cs50-final-project/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
