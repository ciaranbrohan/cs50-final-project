### Next steps
- [ ] allow drag to set multiple walls
- [ ] allow user to see history of algorithm
- [ ] maze algorithm
- [ ] allow playback of historical algorithm
- [ ] improve path not found, intermittent bug here when large amount of walls exist
- [ ] improve rendering of grid, error seems to appear when over 800 nodes
